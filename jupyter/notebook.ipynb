It lets you scale QA models to large collections of documents! \nYou can read more about this amazing library here https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack\n\nFor installation: `! pip install git+https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack.git`\n\nBut just to give a background, there are 3 major components to Haystack.\n1. **Document Store:** Database storing the documents for our search. We recommend Elasticsearch, but have also more light-weight options for fast prototyping (SQL or In-Memory).\n2. **Retriever:** Fast, simple algorithm that identifies candidate passages from a large collection of documents. Algorithms include TF-IDF or BM25, custom Elasticsearch queries, and embedding-based approaches. The Retriever helps to narrow down the scope for Reader to smaller units of text where a given question could be answered.\n3. **Reader:** Powerful neural model that reads through texts in detail to find an answer. Use diverse models like BERT, RoBERTa or XLNet trained via FARM or Transformers on SQuAD like tasks. The Reader takes multiple passages of text as input and returns top-n answers with corresponding confidence scores. You can just load a pretrained model from Hugging Face's model hub or fine-tune it to your own domain data.\n\nAnd then there is **Finder** which glues together a Reader and a Retriever as a pipeline to provide an easy-to-use question answering interface.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# installing haystack\n\n! pip install git+https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack.git","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# importing necessary dependencies\n\nfrom haystack import Finder\nfrom haystack.indexing.cleaning import clean_wiki_text\nfrom haystack.indexing.utils import convert_files_to_dicts, fetch_archive_from_http\nfrom haystack.reader.farm import FARMReader\nfrom haystack.reader.transformers import TransformersReader\nfrom haystack.utils import print_answers","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Setting up DocumentStore\nHaystack finds answers to queries within the documents stored in a `DocumentStore`.
